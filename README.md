# Hexatana
Hexatana is a 36 katana-inspired keyboard designed around [hexagonal keycaps](https://hw.s-ol.nu/HEX-keycaps/), which require Choc v1 switches.
It uses the CH552T controller and [FAK firmware](https://github.com/semickolon/fak).

The electronic design is derived from the [MIAO MCU board](https://github.com/kilipan/miao).

# Buildguide
For soldering everything have a look at the [interactive bill of materials](bom/ibom.html).

After soldering everything plug in the switches into the hot swap sockets and install the keycaps.

Now it is time to configure the firmware.
All config-files needed for an extremely basic firmware to test whether all the keys work can be found [here](https://github.com/ThePurox/fak-config/tree/main/keyboards/hexatana)
